AT&T STORES

This site displays a map of AT&T stores in the Dallas / Fort Worth metroplex.  The map contains markers for each location.  When the page loads, only the map and markers are displayed. Click the menu icon in the top right corner to toggle the list of locations.

The Filter
This filters the list of locations and the corresponding marker on the map.  Type the name of the location and that marker and list item are displayed.  The remaining markers and liste items are not displayed.  If nothing is typed in the filter box, all markers and list items are displayed.

The Markers and List Items
Clicking a marker displays an info window and animates the marker.  The information in each info window is populated with info from wikipedia.  
Clicking a list item triggers a click on the corresponding marker.  This animates the marker and displays the info window. If the same marker or list item is clicked with the info window open, the info window will close
